<h1>Series Rules</h1>

<a href="/goc-progress">Back to index.</a>

<ul>
    <li>Untradeable items are unrestricted.</li>
    <li>Starting out, every item which is tradeable item on the Grand Exchange is locked.</li>
    <li>When locked, items cannot be used for any purpose, picked up from the ground, deposited in my bank, or purchased from a shop.</li>
    <li>Obtaining an item which is tradeable on the G.E. for the first time triggers an unlock all locked items have equal probability of being unlocked.</li>
    <li>Scenery which spawns items in your inventory is fair game even if it looks like an item on the ground (as long as the plugin permits it)!</li>
    <li>While I am not allowed to obtain locked items from shops, I am allowed to obtain locked items via dialogue with NPCs.</li>
    <li>The first time I obtain each pet, I will roll 5 unlocks as a bonus.</li>
</ul>

<h1>RNG</h1>

<p>Since items are regularly added to OSRS, there is no permanent pairing between obtained items and unlocked items.</p>
<p>Instead, the item which gets rolled is determined on-the-fly by a roll.</p>
<p>Each unlock roll uses a persistent seed tied to my account, modified based on the total number of unlocks so far and the item obtained.</p>
<p>When new items are released, I check to see if they are valid (i.e. actually obtainable, not falsely marked as tradeable) and they are then added to the total pool of items available for unlock.</p>
<p>I've tested it thoroughly to make sure it is uniformly random across the available items, and it certainly is.</p>

<p>Below are details about excluded items and the modified way that poisoned items work.</p>

<h1>Removed items</h1>
<p>Item sets (those you obtain at the G.E. in exchange for all items in the set) are removed from the list of unlockable items.</p>
<p>Construction flat packs are removed from the list of unlockable items.</p>

<h1>Poisoned variants</h1>
<p>To avoid there being 3:1 poisoned variants per base item, which was buzzkill unfun trash in my test run, poisoned variants of items are <b>not</b> directly unlocked.</p>
<p>Poisoned variants of items become usable once both the <b>base item and given tier of weapon poison</b> have been both unlocked and obtained.</p>
